        One night, General Pink-Kryptonite escaped to explore the city but when tried to get back home the gates were locked. He felt betrayed and his anger and fury started to grow. His goal is now to extinguish the human race but thatâ€™s not what Captain Gudu wants.
        To protect humans and keep them feeding, petting and taking care of the cats, Captain Gudu now leads The Guardians gang in order to protect those who always protected them."

        Will they be able to win? How does it end? Pick your side to find out!"
